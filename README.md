## Description
This project was my semester exam for autumn 2021, I made an ecommerce website selling watches. I made the design in figma and started coding with Visual Studio Code, the languages I used was HTML, CSS and Javascript. The design is inspired by Rolex and Omega, the site has an exlusive look. The dark colors makes it feel and look more luxurious.
